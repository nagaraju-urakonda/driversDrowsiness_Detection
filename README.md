# DL_COURSE_PROJECT_TEAM_NO_8

For this project we used two image Datasets from Kaggle

1)For CNN we used Driver Drowsiness Dataset (DDD):

About Dataset:

The Driver Drowsiness Dataset (DDD) is an extracted and cropped faces of drivers from the videos of the Real-Life Drowsiness Dataset. The frames were extracted from videos as images using VLC software. After that, the Viola-Jones algorithm has been used to extract the region of interest from captured images. The obtained dataset (DDD) has been used for training and testing CNN architecture for driver drowsiness detection in the “Detection and Prediction of Driver Drowsiness for the Prevention of Road Accidents Using Deep Neural Networks Techniques” paper.

The dataset has the following properties :

• RGB images

• 2 classes (Drowsy & Non Drowsy)

• Size of image : 227 x 227

• More than 41,790 images in total

• File size : 2.32 GB

2)FOR CNN_LSTM HYBRID MODEL WE USED DRIVER DROWSINESS DETECTION SYSTEM DATASET from Kaggle:

Active Subjects: 4560 files

Fatigue Subjects:4560 files

Total: 9120 files
